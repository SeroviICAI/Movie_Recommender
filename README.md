# Movie Recommender:
This program recommends you a movie for any genre. This program uses argparse, so just running the program with no arguments won't execute anything.

In order to run the recommender, on a command prompt type "python "path-to-main"/main.py -h". This will give you the basic instructions on how to run the program.

### Example:
If you have cloned this repository on your desktop, enter the command prompt in your computer (cmd in case you have windows) and type:
<p align="center">
    #### python C:\Users\<fill with username>\Desktop\movie_recomender\src\main.py -h
</p>

This program does not have a graphical interface, so all commands and functions are executed via command prompt.

### Some issues found:
1. The autocomplete function for movie titles does not work perfect.
2. The recommender is yet not very customable.
3. Some exception handling is missing.
